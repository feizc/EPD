# Meta Ensemble Parameter Learning
 
We introduce a new task, referred to meta ensemble parameter learning, which aims to directly predict the parameters of ensemble distillation model based on the parameters of base learners as well as small part of training dataset. 

## 1. Parameter Model 

### 1.1 base model 

VGG-11 and ResNet-50 

Here, we provide two models for ensemble parameters prediction: 

### 1.2 Linear Prediction


### 1.2 WeightFormer 


## 2. Dataset 

We utilze the common image classification datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet for  


## 3. Training
